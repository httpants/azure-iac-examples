# Hosting an Azure function on an Azure Container Apps Environment

This example shows how to deploy an Azure function into an Azure Container Apps environment. 

The example todo list application is written on Go and implemented using [Azure Function custom handlers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers). The application is compiled to a single binary file named 'handler' during the docker image build in Azure Container Registry.

## Pre-requisites

- Bash or WSL shell environment
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Deployment
- clone this repo (azure-iac-examples)
- change working directory to `./scripts` 
  - `$ cd ./bicep/aca-func-app/scripts`
- optionally, modify the deployment location & resource group name

  ```
  RG_NAME='aca-func-go-rg'
  LOCATION='australiaeast'
  ```
- deploy the sample
  - `$ ./deploy.sh`
- script deployment steps
  - deploy resource group
  - deploy Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - build container image in ACR
  - deploy container app environment, Azure Monitor workspace & container app
